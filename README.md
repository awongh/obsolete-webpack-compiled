# obsolete-webpack-compiled
Compiled version of webpack obsolete browser.

This repo has a bare-bones webpack setup that will compile the obsolete webpack library: https://github.com/ElemeFE/obsolete-webpack-plugin

You can then copy this static code into your own site.

### Instructions
Check out a new branch.
Add your own browserlist configs into the webpack.config.js file. (don't use a .browserslistrc file- this is the compilation target config file)
Run it: `npm build`
